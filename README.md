# ppi
A simple calculator to find the pixel density (pixels per inch, PPI) in a display given the pixel dimensions and diagonal of the display. I use this when shopping for monitors to do some quick calculations.

## Usage
### Installation
To install, download the project files, and copy the binary to your local bin file
```sudo cp ./ppi /usr/local/bin```

### Running
Run this command with the dimensions in pixels, and the diagonal of the display in inches.

```ppi width-px height-px diagonal-in```
